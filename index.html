        <h4 id="hobby_bio">My hobby is Bird-Watching. I like it because it is fun to see birds fluttering outside. I do so after finishing my homework. I get up early in the morning to complete my work and then I sit outside to Bird-watch. I am 9 years old and I study in 5th standard. Bird-Watching is just very refreshing. It is mostly in the morning. When I step to the balcony in the moring I hear birds chirping sweetly in the morning. I see many birds fluttering around more in the morning than in the afternoon. Bird-Watching is just a fantasy for me. The main thing is to see the birds in this action. I have seen many birds like piegeons, parrots, finches, owls, galahs, etc. This is why I like Bird-Watching. </h4>
